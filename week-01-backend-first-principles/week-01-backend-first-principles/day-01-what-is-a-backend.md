# Day 01 – What is a Backend?

## What I learned
A backend is the part of a system that receives requests, runs business logic,
and returns responses. It sits between clients (apps, workflows, users) and data or services.

## Small exercise
I called my FastAPI endpoint via the /docs page and identified the client, request, backend logic, and response.

## Automation connection
Low-code tools like n8n act as clients. When workflows fail, the failure usually happens at the backend boundary.

## Open questions
How do backend systems handle unexpected or malformed requests at scale?
