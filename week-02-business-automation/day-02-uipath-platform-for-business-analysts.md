- Data analysis (extract insights, cleaning, transformation, visualization)
- Process automation (order processing, invoice processing, customer service)

---

### Action Center
**Purpose:** Centralized location for managing actionable items and user interactions

**BA-Relevant Features:**
- **Exception Management:** Review and resolve automation exceptions
- **Human-in-the-Loop:** Define points requiring human input
- **Monitoring & Analytics:** Gain insights, identify bottlenecks, optimize workflows

---

### UiPath Apps
**Purpose:** Low-code application development platform

**BA Benefits:**
- Design forms, dashboards, pages without coding
- Link apps directly to Orchestrator processes
- Provide simple interface for business users (submit requests, approvals, uploads)
- Build prototypes to confirm requirements
- Make automation accessible (desktop, web, mobile)

---

### Integration Service
**Purpose:** Bridge connecting UiPath with external applications

**Key Features:**
- Connect to external apps (Salesforce, ServiceNow, Outlook) via ready-to-use connectors
- Enable seamless data exchange across systems
- Reuse integrations across processes
- Ensure secure, governed connections

---

### AI Center
**Purpose:** Build, deploy, and manage AI models for business use cases

**BA Capabilities:**
- Build and train AI models (structured/unstructured data, images, text)
- Deploy AI models to various environments
- Monitor AI model performance (accuracy, response time, resource utilization)

---

### Document Understanding
**Purpose:** AI-powered automation for structured and unstructured documents

**Features:**
- Automate document processing (invoices, receipts, purchase orders)
- Extract data using advanced OCR (tables, forms, handwriting)
- Validate extracted data against business rules

---

## OPERATE Layer Tools

### Orchestrator
**Purpose:** Centralized platform for managing, monitoring, and deploying robots

**BA Use Cases:**
- **Process Management:** Schedule and monitor process execution
- **Robot Management:** Monitor robot status and performance
- **Reporting & Analytics:** Track KPIs, identify trends, make data-driven decisions

---

### Insights
**Purpose:** Analytics tool providing business intelligence and data visualization

**Key Concept:** Pre-built dashboards using RE-Framework queue/process data

**BA Responsibility:** Identify additional data fields needed for custom reporting BEFORE build phase to avoid costly rebuilding

**Example:**
- Default: Total invoices processed per day ✓
- Custom: Invoices by customer ID + individual invoice numbers → Requires additional data elements

**BA Use Cases:**
- **Performance Monitoring:** Real-time KPIs (completed processes, processing time, error rates)
- **Process Analytics:** Execution times, frequency, success rates, exceptions
- **Data Integration:** Correlate with CRM, ERP, databases
- **Compliance & Audit:** Generate reports on user activity, access control, process execution
